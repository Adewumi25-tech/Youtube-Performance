## RECOMMENDATION
ğŸ‘‰ Entertainment, People & Blogs, and Music are the leading categories with the highest number of videos and engagement. We should increase our content production in these areas to attract a larger audience.

ğŸ‘‰ I encourage more interaction through likes, comments, and shares. Consider live streams, community posts, and Q&A sessions to build a stronger connection with our audience.

ğŸ‘‰ Disabling comments and ratings should be avoided as these features drive higher engagement. Videos with these features enabled have been shown to receive higher average views.
